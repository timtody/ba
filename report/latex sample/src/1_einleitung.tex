\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Among a range of other tasks, image recognition has been a domain dominated by feed forward Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Strong evidence suggests, that the human brains ability to rapidly recognize objects under appearance variation is solved in the brain via a succession of largely feedforward computations. \cite[2012]{DICARLO2012415} Recent success of feedforward networks has only supported this hypothesis \cite{NIPS2012_4824}. However, evidence also suggests, that after the initial recognition process further processing takes place \cite{Sugase1999}. This delayed processing might indicate recurrent computations which I want to investigate in this work.
Using a range of convolutional architectures, I try to systematically measure the impact of recursion on image recognition tasks.
